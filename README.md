# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the work and deliverables for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The project involves predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, using data science and machine learning techniques.


## Project Overview

The capstone project simulates a real-world data science task. The goal is to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing, which is crucial for determining the cost efficiency of a rocket launch.


## Business Problem

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost of 62 million dollars compared to other providers, which charge upwards of 165 million dollars. This cost efficiency is largely due to the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. By accurately predicting the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully, the cost of a launch can be estimated.
